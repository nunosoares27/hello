#### Objectives:

1. We'll build this Waypoint on Cloud 9, a powerful online code editor with a full Ubuntu Linux workspace, all running in the cloud.
2. If you don't already have Cloud 9 account, create one now at http://c9.io.
3. Open up http://c9.io and sign in to your account.
4. Click on the "+" icon at the top right of the c9.io page to create a new workspace.
5. Give your workspace a name and an optional description.
6. Choose Node.js in the selection area below the name field.
7. Click the "Create workspace" button.
8. Once C9 builds and loads your workspace, you should see a terminal window in the lower right hand corner. In this window use the following commands. You don't need to know what these mean at this point.
9. Install git-it with this command: npm install -g git-it
10. Before you start, read Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account if you have two-factor authentication set up on your GitHub account.
11. Now start the tutorial by running git-it.
12. Note that you can resize the c9.io's windows by dragging their borders.
13. Make sure that you are always in your project's "workspace" directory. You can always navigate back to this directory by running this command: cd ~/workspace.
14. You can view this Node School module's source code on GitHub at https://github.com/jlord/git-it.
15. Complete "Get Git"
16. Complete "Repository"
17. Complete "Commit to it"
18. Complete "Githubbin"
19. Complete "Remote Control"
